# S-DBMS - Student DBMS with a Simple Query Language for Student Information
> Written by Lewis Kim

S-DBMS is a minature relational database management system (DBMS) that stores tables of data, where each table consists of labeled columns of student information. Some of these include student first/last names, ID's, major, start/graduating years, and academic histories. This DBMS also includes a simple query language for extracting information from these tables. The query language deals with parsing DBMS commands, such as table creations (``create table tname (col1, col2, …);``) and select clauses with conditionals (``select col1, col2,… from tname condition``).
